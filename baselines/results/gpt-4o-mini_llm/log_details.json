In the step 'Run tests', pytest reported numerous failures in the 'test_series_resample' function, indicating a consistent ValueError: 'Index is not contained within new index.' This suggests that the partitions or frequencies used in the tests were not appropriate for the data being processed. The failures were observed across various test cases in the files 'dask/dataframe/tseries/tests/test_resample.py' and 'dask/dataframe/tseries/tests/test_resample_expr.py', leading to a total of 48 test failures, while 16,339 tests passed and 1,013 tests were skipped."
